#This application was built using Eclipse IDE

#The idea of this application is that--
to design a web server responds to requests from web browsers and retrieves and returns requested web files to the browsers 
for display to end users. Browsers may request a variety of different files including web pages (HTML files), images, 
styling information (CSS files), JavaScript, audio, video, and many other file types. 
This web server will only handle simple web pages (HTML files) and several common types of image files.
